# Sentiment Analysis Project

A beginner-friendly Python project that performs **sentiment analysis** on text data using machine learning techniques. This project covers text preprocessing, sentiment classification, and visualization of results. It’s ideal for anyone starting out with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

---

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis helps determine the sentiment or emotion behind a piece of text — classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. This project implements this using Python and common NLP libraries, focusing on clarity and simplicity.

---

## Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
- Visualizations for sentiment distribution and insights
- Easy-to-understand code for beginners

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `nltk`
